# Python exercises
Don't go overboard! All these exercises CAN be done in one file each.

## 1. Simple Calculator
Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.

## 2. Word Guessing Game
Implement a game where the computer randomly selects a word from a list and the player has to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the word and track the number of attempts.

## 3. Hangman Game
Develop the classic Hangman game where the computer chooses a word and the player guesses letters to uncover it. Include visual feedback (like drawing parts of a hangman) based on incorrect guesses.

## 4. Tic-Tac-Toe
Create a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. Allow players to take turns entering their moves and determine the winner or declare a draw based on the game's rules.

## 5. Number Guessing Game
Design a game where the computer picks a random number and the player guesses it. Provide hints (higher or lower) after each guess until the correct number is guessed.

## 6. Text-Based Adventure Game
Develop a simple text-based adventure where players navigate through different rooms, make choices, and encounter challenges. Use functions and conditional statements to manage game flow.

## 7. Bank Account Manager
Build a program that simulates a basic bank account manager. Allow users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. Ensure data validation to prevent negative balances.

## 8. Quiz Game
Create a quiz game with multiple-choice questions. Store questions and answers in lists or dictionaries, present them to the user, and track their score based on correct answers.

## 9. File Encryption/Decryption
Implement a basic encryption and decryption algorithm using file handling. Allow users to encrypt a text file and decrypt it back to its original form using a chosen method (e.g., Caesar cipher).
